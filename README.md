## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my hands-on learning, experiments, and notes related to the **data preprocessing phase of Machine Learning**.

It includes complete Jupyter notebooks covering:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, Feature Selection)

This repo acts as my personal **learning log**, **reference guide**, and **revision notebook** for ML preprocessing topics.
